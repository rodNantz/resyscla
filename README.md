<h1>Resyscla</h1>

Final work for our Systems Analysis and Development graduation at UFPR, done by Rebeca de Melo @rebecademelo, Giuliana Cortes @giucortes, Rodrigo Nantes @rodNantz, Douglas Tebas @dtebas and Felipe Akimiti.

<h3>Product summary</h3>

In Brazil, many cities have appropriate recycling programs (Curitiba was our showcase), but there is lack of information among the population on how to separate the residues, where to discard it, when etc, so we created a platform to inform places of disposal, schedule, and to educate the users.

Resysclaâ€™s goal was to be a mobile Android app that provided withdraw location, disposal instructions and other information concerning solid residues. Besides the app, our platform included an Angular web module to administrate its data, and an Java web service (using a MySql database) to receive the requests, either from the mobile app or from the website.
